# What do you do if there is an issue?

If you find an issue in the app, please log it either on [GitHub](https://github.com/appsbymw/coffee-app/issues) or through the app by taking a screenshot and hitting Submit Feedback from the menu.

# I have a feature request, how do I submit it?

If you have a feature request, also log it on [GitHub](https://github.com/appsbymw/coffee-app/issues)! I'll be able to determine priority, get it labeled currectly, and get it added to the Trello board. I love new ideas and suggestions, so please make sure to get them logged.
